### Description

Great news! Eric O'Sullivan was nice enough to go through the AntieLife revision 2 that I had uploaded, and make a bunch of changes to speed it up. He's given me permission to upload he improved revision 2 here, so I'm submitting it as a replacement for me earlier revision.

Based on and partially derived from Imitate Life v2.0, by Eric O'Sullivan on Planet-Source-Code. This simulation of life uses primative virtual life forms to demonstrate adaptation by natural selection. The name of the program is a bit of a play on words, since the program it was based on used ants and ant-eaters.

Thanks, Eric.

Don.
